# Human Activity Analysis

## Introduction

Have you ever considered that a smartwatch or your phone could play a crucial role in exonerating someone from a murder charge? This real-life story unfolded in the case of Nicole VanderHeyden in 2016.

Douglas Detrie, Nicole's husband, was initially identified as the prime suspect. However, in 2018, unexpected developments occurred in the case.

### The Role of Technology

Prosecutors decided to analyze the data from Nicole's Fitbit smartwatch, a device she had gifted to Doug. This smartwatch was capable of recording precise information about physical activities, including:

- Step counts
- Heart rate
- Sleep patterns

### The Turning Point

The discoveries made from this data led to a dramatic shift in the case. Analysis of the Fitbit data revealed that Doug had not engaged in significant physical activity at the time of the crime and was actually asleep.
